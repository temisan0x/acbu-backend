 * FEE TIER SPECIFICATION:
 * ========================
 * Mint Fees (based on reserve ratio):
 * - Normal: 30 BPS (0.30%) when ratio >= minRatio (1.02)
 * - Stressed: 50 BPS (0.50%) when ratio < minRatio
 * - Max cap: 100 BPS (1.00%)
 * 
 * Burn Fees (based on currency reserve weight vs target):
 * - Low Reserve (<85% of target): 200 BPS (2.00%) - discourage burns
 * - Normal (85-115% of target): 10 BPS (0.10%) - standard fee
 * - High Reserve (>115% of target): 5 BPS (0.05%) - encourage burns
 * 
 * Spread:
 * - Default: 25 BPS (0.25%)
